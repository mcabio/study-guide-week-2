Dictionaries

Why are dictionaries necessary? Why not use a list?
    - You can index using keys instead of numbers (ie. "Get item stored at duck" instead of "get third item")
    - Faster search time. We can find out if 'duck' is in the dictionary right away in lieu of looping through 
      each time, one by one.
    - Lists have to look at every item, which takes longer. 

How is the lookup time in a dictionary different from that of a list?
    - The example used when looping through a list was like looking for the Queen of Hearts inside a deck of cards;
      looking at each card one at a time.
    - Dictionaries are just that, since it's ordered, we would just have to open the dictionary to the letter "Q"
      and flip to the correct page.

How do you create an empty dictionary? How do you create a dictionary with initial content?
    - To create an empty dictonary: empty_dict = {}
    - Creating a dictionary with initial content. In this example, fridge is the dictionary
    and key are contents inside the fridge. Pairs are the amount of each:
    fridge = {'cheese': 3, 'soda': 2, 'ketchup': 1, 'tomato': 4, 'zucchini': 2}

How do you add a new key/value pair to a dictionary? How do you update the value of a key in a dictionary?
    - To update: fridge['zucchini'] = 4
    - To add would be similar: fridge['bread'] = 1

How do you remove a key/value pair from a dictionary?
    - By using the del keyword
    - Ex: del fridge['ketchup']

How do you look up the value for a given key in a dictionary?
    - fridge['soda'] is one way
    - 'tomato' in fridge is another (returns True or False)
    - dict.get is another: fridge.get('cabbage', 'It's not in there')
How do you iterate over a dictionary?
    - Using a for loop: for contents (key) in fridge (name of dictionary):

Print keys?
    - for contents in fridge:
          print(contents)
Print values?
    - for contents in fridge:
          print(fridge[contents])
Print keys and values?
    - fridge[key] = value
    - print(fridge) ?
What is a KeyError? When does one occur?
    - An error that occurs when we are attempting to index into a dictionary 
      with a non-existent key.
    - This also happens when you use square brackets ([]) to retrieve the 
      value associated with a specific key, but the key is not present in the dictionary.
Dictionary methods to know:

.get()
    - used to retrieve the value associated with a specified key in a dictionary. 
      It provides a way to access dictionary elements without raising a KeyError if the key is not present.
      The syntax for dict.get(key, default) is as follows:
        key: The key whose associated value you want to retrieve.
        default: (Optional) The value to be returned if the specified key is not found in the dictionary. 
        If not provided, it defaults to None
.values()
    - This prints out only the values.
    - Ex: fridge.values()
            dict_values([3, 2, 1, 4, 2])
    - Ex: for contents in fridg.values()
            print(contents)
.items()
    - Similar to enumerate. Returns a view object that displays a list of a dictionary's key-value tuple pairs.
      Used when you need to iterate over both keys and values in a dictionary.
    - Ex. 
      my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 25, 'gender': 'Male'}
      items_view = my_dict.items()

      for key, value in items_view:
          print(f"Key: {key}, Value: {value}")

How do you access a dictionary within a dictionary?
    - animals['pony']['bites']
    - In this example, animals is a dictionary of different animals. Pony is one of the animals in the dictionary. 
      'bites' is an attriute (boolean) in the 'pony' dictionary.
    - So the output would be true in the example

When should you use a dictionary?
    - When you want to store information that is accessible by key
    - Counting
    - Fast Lookups: Dictionaries provide fast and efficient lookups 
      based on keys.
    - Mapping Relationships: Dictionaries are well-suited for 
      representing and working with relationships between entities. 
      For example, you can use a dictionary to represent a person's attributes, 
      a product's details, or any other entity with associated properties.
